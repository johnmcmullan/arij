## Description

The board is functional but limited: hardcoded 3 columns (todo/in_progress/done), no filtering, no swimlanes. Enhance to support configurable columns, project filtering, and richer ticket cards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Board columns driven by project status config, not hardcoded
- [ ] Project filter dropdown on board
- [ ] Ticket cards show priority, type, and assignee
- [ ] Swimlane grouping option (by project or assignee)
