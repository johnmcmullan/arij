## Description

Status can only be changed via drag-and-drop on the board. Add a status dropdown on the ticket detail page that PATCHes the status inline without a full page reload.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Status displayed as a dropdown on ticket detail view
- [ ] Changing the dropdown fires a PATCH request to `/tickets/:id/status`
- [ ] Page updates visually without full reload (fetch + DOM update)
- [ ] Status badge color updates to match new status
