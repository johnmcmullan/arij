## Description

No authentication exists. Anyone can create, view, and modify all projects and tickets. Add session-based auth with user accounts so comments and tickets are tied to real users.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Session-based authentication (express-session)
- [ ] Protected routes (must be logged in to create/edit)
- [ ] Logged-in user auto-set as comment author and ticket reporter
