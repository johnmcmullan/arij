## Description

No search or filtering exists. Users can't find tickets except by browsing project lists or the board. Add search across titles/descriptions and filter controls on project and board views.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Global search bar in nav that searches ticket titles and descriptions
- [ ] Filter controls on project ticket list (by status, assignee, type, priority)
- [ ] Filter by project on the board view
- [ ] URL query params preserve filter state
