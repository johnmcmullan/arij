## Description

The Arij config defines `priorities: [critical, high, medium, low]` but the DB schema has no priority column. Add an `ALTER TABLE` migration and update create/edit forms, ticket detail view, and board cards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `priority` column added to tickets table (TEXT, nullable, default 'medium')
- [ ] Priority dropdown in ticket create and edit forms
- [ ] Priority badge displayed on ticket detail and board cards
- [ ] Priority color coding (critical=red, high=orange, medium=blue, low=gray)
