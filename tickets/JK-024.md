## Description

No tests exist. Add integration tests using supertest + a test framework (mocha or jest). Tests should cover all routes with both happy paths and error cases, using an in-memory SQLite database.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test framework configured (jest or mocha + chai)
- [ ] In-memory SQLite database for test isolation
- [ ] Tests for all GET routes (projects list, project detail, ticket detail, board)
- [ ] Tests for all POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE routes
- [ ] Tests for error cases (404, invalid input)
- [ ] `npm test` script in package.json
