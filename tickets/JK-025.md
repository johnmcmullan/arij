## Description

The Arij config defines statuses as `[backlog, todo, in-progress, review, done]` (with hyphens) but the SQLite schema and app code use `in_progress` (underscore). The board view hardcodes `todo`, `in_progress`, `done` while the config has 5 statuses including `backlog` and `review`.

This mismatch means tickets created through the web UI won't align with the Arij spec, and the board ignores two of the five configured statuses.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Decide on canonical status format (hyphens vs underscores)
- [ ] Align DB schema, app code, and Arij config to use the same values
- [ ] Board supports all 5 statuses from config
