## Description

Board columns are hardcoded to `todo`, `in_progress`, `done`. The Arij config defines `statuses: [backlog, todo, in-progress, review, done]`. Drive columns from the config or from a project's defined statuses.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Board reads statuses from config (or DB if statuses are stored there)
- [ ] Columns are generated dynamically, not hardcoded in the template
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works across any number of columns
- [ ] Column headers use human-readable labels
