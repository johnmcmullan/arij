## Description

Minimal input validation exists (only project key format check). Add server-side validation for all form submissions: required fields, length limits, valid enum values for status/type/priority.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project creation: name required, key must be 2-5 uppercase letters, unique
- [ ] Ticket creation: title required (max 200 chars), status must be valid enum
- [ ] Comment creation: body required, not empty after trim
- [ ] Validation errors re-render the form with error messages and preserved input
