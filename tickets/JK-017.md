## Description

The board currently shows all tickets from all projects. Add a project filter dropdown so users can scope the board to a single project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project dropdown at top of board page
- [ ] `GET /board?project=:id` filters tickets to that project
- [ ] "All Projects" option to show everything (current behavior)
- [ ] Selected project persists across page loads (query param)
