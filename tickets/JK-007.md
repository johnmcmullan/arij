## Description

There's no way to edit a ticket after creation. Add `GET /tickets/:id/edit` to render an edit form and `PUT /tickets/:id` to persist changes. The form should allow editing title, description, status, and assignee.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Edit button on ticket detail page links to edit form
- [ ] Edit form pre-populates with current values
- [ ] PUT route updates the ticket and redirects back to detail
- [ ] `updated_at` timestamp is set on save
