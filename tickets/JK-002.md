## Description

The current SQLite schema only has: title, description, status, assignee. The Tract config defines types and priorities but the DB doesn't support them. Enrich the data model to support priority, type, labels, and due dates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Priority field (critical, high, medium, low) on tickets
- [ ] Type field (bug, story, task, epic) on tickets
- [ ] Labels/tags with many-to-many support
- [ ] Due date field on tickets
- [ ] All new fields exposed in create/edit forms and ticket views
