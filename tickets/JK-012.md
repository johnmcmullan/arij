## Description

The config defines `types: [bug, story, task, epic]` but the DB has no type column. Add the column and expose it in the UI with distinct icons or labels per type.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `type` column added to tickets table (TEXT, nullable, default 'task')
- [ ] Type selector in ticket create and edit forms
- [ ] Type icon/badge on ticket detail view and board cards
- [ ] Board can be filtered by type
