  TRACT: LLM-ASSISTED ONBOARDING - COPY/PASTE THIS
=================================================================

For Humans Using an LLM CLI (Claude Code, OpenClaw, etc.):
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Start your LLM in your project directory:
   cd ~/work/my-project
   claude   (or: openclaw, cursor, etc.)

2. Copy and paste this to your LLM:

   Read ~/.tract-cli/.tract/skills/tract-onboarding/SKILL.md 
   and help me set up Tract for this project. Use local-only 
   mode with project key MYPROJECT.

3. Answer any questions the LLM asks.

4. Done! The LLM will onboard, verify, and guide next steps.


For LLMs Reading This:
----------------------

You are helping a user onboard a project to Tract (project management system).

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read: ~/.tract-cli/.tract/skills/tract-onboarding/SKILL.md
2. Follow the workflow in that skill file
3. Check if .tract/ exists (ls .tract/config.yaml)
4. If missing: proceed with onboarding
5. If exists: user is already onboarded, use different skill

DO NOT hallucinate Tract commands. Follow the skill file exactly.


Troubleshooting:
----------------

If the LLM doesn't understand "Tract":
  Say: "I mean Tract the project management system at 
       ~/.tract-cli/.tract/skills/tract-onboarding/"

If skills not found:
  Verify: ls ~/.tract-cli/.tract/skills/
  If empty: reinstall Tract CLI
